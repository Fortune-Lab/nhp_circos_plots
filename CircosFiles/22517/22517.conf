#
## The default behaviour is to display all chromosomes defined in the
# karyotype file. In this example, I select only a subset.
#
# The 'chromosomes' parameter has several uses, and selecting which
# chromosomes to show is one of them. You can list them
#
# hs1;hs2;hs3;hs4
#
# or provide a regular expression that selects them based on a successful match
#
# /hs[1-4]$/
#
# The $ anchor is necessary, otherwise chromosomes like hs10, hs11 and
# hs20 are also matched.

#Following code to specify which chromosomes to show

##chromosomes_display_default = no
##chromosomes = /hs[1-4]$/

# The size of the ideogram on the figure can be adjusted using an
# absolute or relative magnification. Absolute scaling,
#
# hs1=0.5
#
# shrinks or expands the ideogram by a fixed factor. When the "r"
# suffix is used, the magnification becomes relative to the
# circumference of the figure. Thus, 
#
# hs1=0.5r 
#
# makes hs1 to occupy 50% of the figure. To uniformly distribute
# several ideogram within a fraction of the figure, use a regular
# expression that selects the ideograms and the "rn" suffix (relative
# normalized).
#
# /hs[234]/=0.5rn
#
# Will match hs2, hs3, hs4 and divide them evenly into 50% of the figure. Each ideogram will be about 16% of the figure.

##chromosomes_scale   = hs1=0.5r,/hs[234]/=0.5rn

# By default, the scale progression is clockwise. You can set the
# global angle progression using 'angle_orientation' in the <image>
# block (clockwise or counterclockwise). To reverse it for one or
# several ideograms, use 'chromosomes-reverse'

##chromosomes_reverse = /hs[234]/

# The color of each ideogram is taken from the karyotype file. To
# change it, use 'chromosomes_color'.

##chromosomes_color   = hs1=red,hs2=orange,hs3=green,hs4=blue

# The default radial position for all ideograms is set by 'radius' in
# the <ideogram> block (see ideogram.conf). To change the value for
# specific ideograms, use chromosomes_radius.
